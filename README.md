#### A bit about myself:

- 🔭 My passion lies at the interface of Software and Hardware
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a graduate degree from [Columbia Univerity](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/) (New York) in Computer Engineering
- 👨‍💼 Worked at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/) (Singapore) for over 3 years prior to Columbia, in post silicon product development
- 💬 Ask me about what motivates me
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love running long distance. Clocking 4:30/Km over a 5Km run, not too bad for a non-professional..

#### Current Projects:

- @**Programming Systems Lab** (Columbia University): Improving system performance w.r.t network I/O using extended-BFP [Link](https://ebpf.io/)
- @**Operating Systems Course Project** (Columbia University): Implementing custom scheduler for the Linux kernel
- @**Embedded Systems Design Course Project** (Columbia University): Implementing a video game using the Intel DE1-SOC board. Project involves both, writing System Verilog code to syntesize hardware on the Cyclone V FPGA and software in C to interface with the hardware (linux device drivers) which includes multiple peripherals like display, keys and the likes, as well as user level code to run the game.
